			<h1>CYBER SECURITY</h1>
			<p>Cyber security is the application of technologies, processes, and controls to protect systems, networks, programs, devices and data from cyber attacks.It aims to reduce the risk of cyber attacks and protect against the unauthorised exploitation of systems, networks, and technologies. Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few common categories.</p>

	<h1>A strong cybersecurity strategy can provide a good security posture against malicious attacks designed to access, alter, delete, destroy or extort an organization's or user's systems and sensitive data. Cybersecurity is also instrumental in preventing attacks that aim to disable or disrupt a system's or device's operations.</h1>

			<h3>Why is cybersecurity important?</h3>
			<p>With an increasing number of users, devices and programs in the modern enterprise, combined with the increased deluge of data -- much of which is sensitive or confidential -- the importance of cybersecurity continues to grow. The growing volume and sophistication of cyber attackers and attack techniques compound the problem even further.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="subject-col">
			<h3>What are the elements of cybersecurity and how does it work?</h3>
			<p>The cybersecurity field can be broken down into several different sections, the coordination of which within the organization is crucial to the success of a cybersecurity program. These sections include the following:Application security,Information or data security, Network security,and etc.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="subject-col">
			<h3>What are the benefits of cybersecurity?</h3>
			<p>The benefits of implementing and maintaining cybersecurity practices include,Business protection against cyberattacks and data breaches,Protection for data and networks,Prevention of unauthorized user access, Improved recovery time after a breach, Protection for end users and endpoint devices, Regulatory compliance, Business continuity, Improved confidence in the company's reputation and trust for developers, partners, customers, stakeholders and employees.</p>

			<h3>What are the top cybersecurity challenges?</h3>
			<p>Cybersecurity is continually challenged by hackers, data loss, privacy, risk management and changing cybersecurity strategies. The number of cyberattacks is not expected to decrease in the near future. Moreover, increased entry points for attacks, such as with the arrival of the internet of things (IoT), increase the need to secure networks and devices.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="subject-col">
			<h3>What are the different types of cybersecurity threats?</h3>
			<p>The process of keeping up with new technologies, security trends and threat intelligence is a challenging task. It is necessary in order to protect information and other assets from cyberthreats, which take many forms. Including Malware,Ransomware, Phishing, Social Engineering, and etc. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="subject-col">
			<h3>How is automation used in cybersecurity?</h3>
			<p>Automation has become an integral component to keep companies protected from the growing number and sophistication of cyberthreats. Using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in areas with high-volume data streams can help improve cybersecurity in three main categories: Threat detection. Threat response. and Human augmentation. </p>

	<h1>“Information is a significant component of most organizations’ competitive strategy either by the direct collection, management, and interpretation of business information or the retention of information for day-to-day business processing. Some of the more obvious results of IS failures include reputational damage, placing the organization at a competitive disadvantage, and contractual noncompliance.
